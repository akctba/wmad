    <h1>CICCC WMAD</h1>
    <h2>Web and Mobile Application Development</h2>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>1. Intro to computing (2 weeks)</h3>
        <p>This course is an introductory to the basics of computer hardware, software, and operating systems. Students will use this knowledge to understand and distinguish between programming languages and their respective platforms.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>2. Algorithims, flowcharts and problem solving (3 weeks)</h3>
        <p>Understanding the vocabulary, grammar, and syntax is key to solving programming problems. All programming languages have been created around a fundamental set of principles. This course introduces the theory and practice of programming logic without using a specific programming language, but rather the basic syntax and logic found in all programming languages.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>3. Java (8 weeks)</h3>
        <p>Using Java, students are introduced to object-oriented programming (OOP), the concept of organizing and grouping information within ‘objects’ used to contain data. Topics will include classes, objects, data types, constructors, methods, flow control, collections, data abstraction, modularity, testing, debugging, and specific object-oriented programming concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>4. Web Dev I - HTML & CSS (6 weeks)</h3>
        <p>Students will learn the principles and techniques behind the design and development of effective web sites. As the foundation for several advanced web applications, this hands-on course provides an introduction to web technologies including, HTML, CSS, and FTP file management software. This course will also provide an introduction to advanced languages such as JavaScript, used for client-side scripting, and PHP, used for server-side scripting.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>5. Web Dev II - JS (6 weeks)</h3>
        <p>Continuing from Web Development I, students will to gain a deeper understanding of web programming using HTML5 and CSS3 by focusing on responsive design, for both desktop and mobile applications, using Media Queries. Students will also use frameworks such as jQuery and JavaScript to add functionality to their websites to enhance the user experience of their web sites.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>6. React.js and Modern Javascript (9 weeks)</h3>
        <p>First implemented in Facebook’s 2011 news feed, React is a Javascript library used to build user interfaces. In this challenging, hands-on course students will apply the concepts of Web Development I and II and learn to create fast and modular applications using React, Document Object Model (DOM), JavaScript ES6, JSX, and Redux. This course focuses on structuring and developing industry standard single page applications.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>7. Node.js (6 weeks)</h3>
        <p>Node.js is a multi-platform open source server environment used to communicate information between the client and the server including, data collection and file management. Students will use their comprehensive understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and learn to use the Node.js programming asynchronous model, along with data storage and package management, to build networked web applications.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <h3>8. Program project</h3>
        <p>This course gives students the opportunity to practice and apply the knowledge they have gained to create a real-world Web, iOS, or Android application. The students will create a proposal for their development project and submit it to their instructor for approval. Once approved, students will develop and demonstrate their project with a final presentation.</p>
